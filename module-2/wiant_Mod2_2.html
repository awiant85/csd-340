        <h2>Chapter 1: Background</h2>

        <p class="intro">I was born in Newark, Delaware and grew up in a town called Middletown. 
            It is a small town but had everything you could ever need. 
            My schools were all within 10 minutes of each other and all the store were a couple miles away</p>

        <p> I grew up living with my mom and sister most of the time. 
            I had a couple of dogs, fish, and birds and other pets. 
            My sister is 3 years older than me</p>

        <p> My hobbies include playing and watching sports. 
            I grew up playing baseball, soccer and golf. 
            I moved to Florida almost 3 years ago and have continued to play golf.</p>

        <p> <span class="sentence"> Now in Florida, I work for Walt Disney World.</span>
            I am a monorail pilot and trainer for the department.
            In my free time I like to go to the amusement parks and go golfing and for runs.</p>
